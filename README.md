## User Story

AS AN employer
- I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio

- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work

- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
